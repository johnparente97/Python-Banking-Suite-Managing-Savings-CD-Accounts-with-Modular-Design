# Python Banking Suite: Managing Savings & CD Accounts with Modular Design

## Overview

The Python Banking Suite is designed to manage savings and certificate of deposit (CD) accounts using a modular design approach. This project leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a flexible and scalable banking system.

## Features

- **Account Management**: Create and manage savings and CD accounts with unique attributes and methods.
- **Modular Design**: The system is built using a modular design, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.
- **Interest Calculation**: Automatically calculate and apply interest to savings and CD accounts.
- **Transaction Handling**: Support for deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python and object-oriented programming
- Familiarity with financial concepts related to savings and CD accounts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/johnparente97/Python-Banking-Suite-Managing-Savings-CD-Accounts-with-Modular-Design.git

## Analysis

### Design & Architecture

- The Python Banking Suite employs a modular design, which enhances the system's maintainability and scalability. By using classes and objects, the system encapsulates account-related data and behaviors, making it easier to manage and extend.

### Account Management

- The system supports two types of accounts: Savings and CD. Each account type has specific attributes and methods, such as interest calculation and transaction handling. This separation of concerns ensures that each account type is managed appropriately according to its unique requirements.

### Interest Calculation

- Interest calculation is a critical feature of the banking suite. The system automatically calculates and applies interest to savings and CD accounts based on predefined rates. This feature ensures that account balances are updated accurately over time.

### Transaction Handling

- The banking suite supports essential transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. These transactions are handled through well-defined methods within the account classes, ensuring that all operations are performed securely and accurately.

### Scalability

- The modular design of the Python Banking Suite allows for easy scalability. New account types or features can be added without significant changes to the existing codebase. This flexibility makes the system adaptable to future requirements and enhancements.
